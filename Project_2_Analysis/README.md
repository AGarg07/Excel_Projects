# Project 2 Analysis

## Introduction

As an early-career seeker, I‚Äôve always been surprised by the lack of data exploring the most optimal jobs and skills in the data science market. I set out to understand what skills top employers request and how to land more pay.

### Questions to Analyze

To understand the data science job market, I asked the following:

1. **Do more skills get you better pay?**
2. **What is the remuneration for data science jobs in different regions?**
3. **What are the top skills of data professionals?**
4. **What is the pay for the top 10 skills?**

### Excel Skills Used

The following Excel skills were utilized for analysis:

- **Pivot Tables**
- **Pivot Charts**
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**
- **Power Query**
- **Power Pivot**

### Data Jobs Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains real-world data science job information from 2023. The dataset is available via Luke Barousse's Excel course.

It includes detailed information on:

- **Job titles**
- **Salaries**
- **Locations**
- **Skills**

## 1Ô∏è‚É£¬†Do more skills get you better pay?

### Skill: Power Query (ETL)

####  Extract

- I first used Power Query to extract the original data (`data_salary_all.xlsx`) and create two queries:
    -  First one with all the data jobs information.
    -  The second listing the skills for each job ID.

####  Transform

- Then, I transformed each query by changing column types, removing unnecessary columns, cleaning text to eliminate specific words, and trimming excess whitespace.
    -  data_jobs_salary

    -  data_job_skills

####  Load

- Finally, I loaded both transformed queries into the workbook, setting the foundation for my subsequent analysis.
    -  data_jobs_salary

        <img width="1906" height="880" alt="analysis_3" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f7e2fba-567a-44ee-9344-b8334b0ec46b" />

    -  data_job_skills

       <img width="1901" height="848" alt="analysis_4" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f17fce4-bbed-4f86-bd93-0f469d3b2606" />

###  Analysis

####  Insights

- There is a positive correlation between the number of skills requested in job postings and the median salary, particularly in roles like Senior Data Engineer and Data Scientist.
- Roles that require fewer skills, like Business Analyst, tend to offer lower salaries, suggesting that more specialized skill sets command higher market value.

####  

- This trend emphasizes the value of acquiring multiple relevant skills, particularly for individuals aiming for higher-paying roles.

## 2Ô∏è¬†What‚Äôs the salary for data jobs in different regions?

###  Skills: PivotTables & DAX

#### Pivot Table

-  I created a PivotTable using the Data Model I created with Power Pivot.
-  I moved the `job_title_short` to the rows area and `salary_year_avg` into the values area.
-  Then I added new measure to calculate the median salary for United States jobs.
    ```
    =CALCULATE(
        MEDIAN(data_jobs_all[salary_year_avg]),
        data_jobs_all[job_country] = "United States")
    ```

####  DAX

- To calculate the median year salary I used DAX.

    ```
    Median Salary := MEDIAN(data_jobs_all[salary_year_avg])
    ```

###  Analysis

####  Insights

- Job roles like Data Engineer and Data Scientist command higher median salaries both in India and internationally, showcasing the global demand for high-level data expertise.
- The salary disparity between Indian and Non-Indian roles is particularly notable in high-tech jobs, which might be influenced by a lack of tech industries in India.

- These salary insights are important for planning and salary negotiations, helping professionals and companies align their offers with market standards while considering geographical variations.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£¬†What are the top skills of data professionals?

###  Skill: Power Pivot

####  Power Pivot

- I created a data model by integrating the `data_jobs_all` and `data_jobs_skills` tables into one model.
- Since I had already cleaned the data using Power Query; Power Pivot created a relationship between these two tables.

####  Data Model

- I created a relationship between my two tables using the `job_id` column.

#### üìÉ Power Pivot Menu

- The Power Pivot menu was used to refine my data model and makes it easy to create measures.

### Analysis

#### Insights

-  SQL and Python dominate as top skills in data-related jobs, reflecting their foundational role in data processing and analysis.
-  Emerging technologies like AWS and Azure also show significant presence, underlining the industry's shift towards cloud services and big data technologies.

- Understanding prevalent skills in the industry not only helps professionals stay competitive but also guides training and educational programs to focus on the most impactful technologies.

## 4Ô∏è‚É£¬†What‚Äôs the pay of the top 10 skills?

###  Skill: Advanced Charts (Pivot Chart)

####  PivotChart

- I created a combo PivotChart to plot median salary and skill likelihood (%) from my PivotTable.
    -  **Primary Axis:** Median Salary (as a Clustered Column)
    -  **Secondary Axis:** Skill Likelihood (as a Line with Markers)
- To customize the chart, I added a title axis title, removed the lines (skill likelihood), and changed the markers to diamonds.

###  Analysis

#### Insights

-  Higher median salaries are associated with skills like Python, Oracle, and SQL, suggesting their critical role in high-paying tech jobs.
-  Spark has the highest median salaries and lowest likelihood, indicating specialization and demand in high-salary sectors.
